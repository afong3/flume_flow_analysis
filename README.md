# flume_flow_analysis
We're setting up a small 2m flume for sediment transport research. I want to know how well the flow can be throttled, analytically. This is going to be the place for the data to be recorded form a serial output of the flow meter. And for the analysis that follows to see how well the flow can be controlled.
